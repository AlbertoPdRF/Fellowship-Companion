## Description
Fellowship Companion is a web app that will help you peek into MLH Fellowship activities. This will contain day-to-day activities of fellows.

## Inspiration
While working on open-source projects in MLH Fellowship we saw people being curious about their progress, their contributions and also about the progress that other fellows are making. So, we came up with an idea of making a web app that can track every single step of MLH Fellowship and let everyone see whats going on inside the Fellowship.
